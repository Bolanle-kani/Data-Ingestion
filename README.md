# Data-Ingestion of github users in the Machine learning Field


# SECTION A (Data Ingestion and API Communication) - Python
In this part.[https://github.com/Bolanle-kani/Data-Ingestion/blob/main/Github%20ML%20users.ipynb] I ingested github data of techies or github users in the Machine
learning Field in the following locations on github. (Lagos, Nigeria,
Rwanda). Github search was used for users API for this task. The final result for this task contains a dataframe that
contains details of Github Users who do Machine Learning from the
three location tags indicated above. A sample search Keyword for users
would be like “Machine Learning location: Lagos”
a. The expected data points to be ingested or seen in the data
frame include name, login/username, Bio, Blog, Company, email,
followers(count of followers), following(count of following), id, url,
and location.)

# SECTION B (Data Analytics - ML & Business Analytics) - Python or SQL

Here[https://github.com/Bolanle-kani/Data-Ingestion/blob/main/Part%20B.ipynb] performed credit scoring
I went from unsupervised to supervised by first creating
clusters and getting the cluster or segment of users likely to default.
From which I took a Supervised classification approach to
generate credit scores
